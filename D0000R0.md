# Wording

## Allow array assignment

Changes to [expr.ass] p2

> [2]{.pnum} In simple assignment [(=)]{.rm}[of the form `E1 = E2`, when the left operand is not of array type,]{.add} the object referred to by the left operand is modified by replacing its value with the result of the right operand. [If the left operand is of type "array of `M T`", the right operand shall be of type "array of `N T`" where `N ≤ M`; the effect is identical to performing `E1[i] = E2[i]` for each `0 ≤ i < N`.]{.add}

## Allow array initialization

Changes to [dcl.init] p17 sub 5

> [17.5]{.pnum} Otherwise, if the destination type is an array, the object is initialized as follows. Let `x₁, …, xₖ` be the elements of the *expression-list* [or array denoted by the initializer expression if the source type is "array of `k T`"]{.add}. If the destination type is an array of unknown bound, it is defined as having `k` elements. Let `n` denote the array size after this potential adjustment. If `k` is greater than `n`, the program is ill-formed. Otherwise, the `iᵗʰ` array element is copy-initialized with `xᵢ` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ k`, and value-initialized for each `k < i ≤ n`. For each `1 ≤ i < j ≤ n`, every value computation and side effect associated with the initialization of the `iᵗʰ` element of the array is sequenced before those associated with the initialization of the `jᵗʰ` element.

## Allow returning arrays

Changes to [dcl.fct] p11

> [11]{.pnum} Functions shall not have a return type of [function]{.add} type[ array or function]{.rm}, although they may have a return type of type pointer or reference to [such things]{.rm}[function]{.add}. There shall be no arrays of functions, although there can be arrays of pointers to functions.
